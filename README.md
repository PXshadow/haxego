# haxego

Haxe to Go Compiler

## Why GoLang
* Great Performance vs GC Balance
* Great Solid Tooling
* Faster compilation then CPP
* Truly cross platform (win, lin, bsd, wasm, avr, ++)
* Bunch of backend libraries
* Together with go2hx, we could work with both together.

## Idea

Based on ideas (and code) from luaxe https://github.com/bradparks/LuaXe/tree/master/luaxe/boot

OOP concepts in golang (https://github.com/luciotato/golang-notes/blob/master/OOP.md)

hx2go (https://github.com/pxshadow/go2hx)

Almost like Javascript, Plus some static typing/structs for simple objects to speed it up forther https://github.com/owenthereal/godzilla

Currently I am working on it only early morning, and late nights (usualy after going over the manual process of converting a project from rich haxe to poor golang), I wish I could work on it more time, if you wish too you may consider a pull request  (link?) or sponsor some time.
